Origami Social Networking Website Implementation

This code used to run on my high school servers, but unfortunately since I no longer go there it was taken down. I am still looking into putting it back online
To interact with the code, you should first start on the css login page, make an account, and continue from there. Note that some users are already loaded on the website to interact with as well
